Barometer Sample
================

This sample demonstrates the use of the Windows.Devices.Sensors.Barometer API.

**Note**  This sample was created using one of the universal app templates available in Visual Studio. It shows how its solution is structured so it can run on both Windows 10 and Windows Phone 10.

This sample allows the user to view the pressure reading as a hPa value. You can choose one of two scenarios:

-   Barometer Data Events
-   Polling Barometer Readings

**Barometer Data Events**

When you choose the **Enable** button for the **Data Events** option, the app will begin streaming barometer readings in real time.

**Polling barometer Readings**

When you choose the **Get Data** button for the **Polling** option, the app will retrieve the current sensor readings.

**Note**  For Windows 8 app samples, download the [Windows 8 app samples pack](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=301698). The samples in the Windows 8 app samples pack will build and run only on Microsoft Visual Studio 2012.

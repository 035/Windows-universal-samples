# Relative Orientation Sensor Sample

This sample demonstrates the use of the Windows.Devices.Sensors.SimpleOrientationSensor API for a simple device orientation sensor.

This sample allows the user to view the orientation values that reflect the simple device orientation. You can choose one of two scenarios:

-   Orientation sensor data events
-   Polling orientation sensor readings

### Simple Orientation Sensor Data Events

When you choose the Enable button for the **Data Events** option, the app will begin displaying sensor readings in real time.

### Polling Simple Orientation Sensor Readings

When you choose the Enable button for the **Polling** option, the app will retrieve the current sensor readings.

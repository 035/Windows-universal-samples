This sample demonstrates how to create an AllJoyn Universal app using Code Generation with Introspection XML and Windows.Devices.AllJoyn.

Specifically, this sample covers:

-   Creating and launching a Secure AllJoyn Client
-   Implementing a method call from generated code.

Note: Authentication is not implemented in this version of the sample. Security implementation will be added to this sample in the next version. Stay tuned :)
